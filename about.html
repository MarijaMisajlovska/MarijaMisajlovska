        <div id="tekst1">Hi there! I'm a 19-year-old student deeply passionate about programming and technology.
            Currently,
            I'm pursuing my studies in computer programming at FINKI, aiming to turn my fascination with coding into a
            fulfilling
            career.<br><br>

            From a young age, I've been captivated by how things work, and this curiosity naturally led me to the world
            of
            programming. I enjoy the process of solving complex problems and bringing creative ideas to life through
            code.
            My journey so far has allowed me to explore various programming languages and technologies, and I'm always
            eager
            to learn more and expand my skills.<br>
            In addition to my studies, I love working on personal projects, collaborating with peers on innovative
            ideas,
            and staying updated with the latest trends in the tech industry. When I'm not coding, you can find me
            reading
            tech blogs, playing video games, or tinkering with new gadgets.<br><br>

            I also value the importance of friendships in my life. True friends provide a sense of belonging and
            emotional
            support, enriching my experiences and helping me grow as a person. Whether it's sharing a laugh, offering a
            listening ear, or tackling challenges together, friendships are a cornerstone of my life. They remind me
            that
            life is not just about individual achievements but also about the connections we build and the memories we
            create with others.<br><br>

    <div id="goal">
        <div>
            I believe that the future of technology holds limitless possibilities, and I am excited to be a part of this
            dynamic and ever-evolving field. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact
            and
            to continue growing as a programmer and problem solver.<br><br>
